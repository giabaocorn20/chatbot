# Chatbot - Building a Chatbot from Scratch

This project is a chatbot developed from scratch using Python and TensorFlow. The chatbot is designed to interact with users and provide intelligent responses to their inputs. It utilizes a sequence-to-sequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to achieve accurate and engaging interactions.

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to create an AI-powered chatbot capable of understanding natural language inputs and generating contextually relevant responses. Using LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence models, the chatbot can retain important information over extended sequences, leading to more coherent and meaningful user interactions.

## Features

- Natural Language Processing: The chatbot can understand and process natural language inputs from users.
- LSTM-based Model: The chatbot's core architecture is based on LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence models for effective information retention.
- Engaging Interactions: The chatbot generates contextually appropriate responses, making the conversations with users more engaging.
- Python and TensorFlow: The project is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow framework for efficient machine learning computations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the chatbot, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
3. Train the chatbot on a dataset of your choice or utilize the pre-trained model.
4. Run the chatbot and start interacting!

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Usage

The chatbot will start interacting with you, responding to your inputs based on the trained model.
